/*!
 This protocol should be implemented by any object that needs to be stored in a database as a single column. This protocol is not for objects that will be persisted as a table, but only those that need to be persisted inside a column of a table. This is primarily for objects that store numbers, text, dates, and other values that can easily be represented in a column of a database table. For more complex objects, subclass SQLitePersistentObject

 Returns the SQL data type to use to store this object in a SQLite3 database. Must be one of kSQLiteColumnTypeText, kSQLIteColumnTypeInteger, kSQLiteColumnTypeReal, kSQLiteColumnTypeBlob

 This method returns an autoreleased object from column data pulled from the database.
